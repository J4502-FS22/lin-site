    <h2 id="1">1. Steamroller</h2>
        <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">> 
        <p>Aren’t we all tired of being sad? An early track of Bridgers’, she proves she doesn’t need anything more than 6 strings and a couple rhyming couplets about being incurably in love with a friend to hurt your feelings. </p>
        <p>Best lyrics: “You’re a brother to me/You’re my partner in crime/You’re the feeling I get when I’m feeling fine.”</p>

        <h2 id="2">2. Moon Song</h2>
        <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">>
            <p>Moon Song might be the internet’s favorite sad Phoebe Bridgers song, and for good reason: the lyrics are simple but poignant, the melody is compelling and the subject of this song is rumored to be Bridgers’ bandmate and frontman of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst.</p>
            <p>Best lyrics: “You are sick/And you’re married/And you might be dying/But you’re holding me like water in your hands.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="3">3. Funeral</h2>
            <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">>
            <p>When Phoebe Bridgers performs this song live, she tells her audience starkly, “This song is about death.” And it is. And also, it isn’t. She sings eloquently about depression, dreams and her childhood bedroom with a muted earnestness that comes from her doubled vocal line. </p>
            <p>Best lyrics: “Jesus Christ, I’m so blue all the time/And that’s just how I feel/Always have and I always will.”</p>

        <h2 id="4">4. Halloween</h2>
        <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">> 
            <p>Often overlooked on Bridgers’ sophomore album, Punisher, Halloween exemplifies Bridgers’ ability to sing about something by not really singing about it. Over the course of the song, using references and allusions, Bridgers likens the story of a “ <a href = "https://genius.com/Phoebe-bridgers-halloween-lyrics">dead relationship</a>” to Halloween over an uneven, off-putting instrumental line.</p>
            <p>Best lyrics: “Always surprised by what I’d do for love/Some things I never expect/They killed a fan down by the stadium/Was only visiting, they beat him to death.”</p>

        <h2 id="5">5. Me & My Dog</h2>
            <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">>
            <p>Who knew a Black pug could be the source of so much strife? Me & My Dog, a song Bridgers wrote in collaboration with Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker (fellow members of the girl group, boygenius) absolutely violates. Clipped lyrics that sound like they’re coming out between sobs, ghostly backup vocals and a powerful, belted final line make this song downright difficult to listen to.</p>
            <p>Best lyrics: “I wanna be emaciated/I want to hear one song without thinking of you/I wish I was on a spaceship/Just me and my dog and an impossible view.”</p>

        <h2 id="6">6. Scott Street</h2>
            <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">>
            <p>Scott Street has possibly the greatest opening two lines and outro of any song in her discography. Deceptively simple lyrics narrate walking down a street and catching up with an old friend. “I guess ‘Scott Street’ is about being really lonely,” Bridgers told <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/phoebe-bridgers-stranger-in-the-alps-interview">Bandcamp</a> in 2017. “Sometimes I want to cop out and say it’s about a lot of different things, but really it’s all there. It’s just a diary.”</p>   
            <p>Best lyrics: “Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger/With an open heart, open container.”</p>

        <h2 id="7">7. I Know the End</h2>
            <img src="https://j4502-fs22.github.io/harry-potter-site/images/placeholder.jpg" class ="image" alt = "A placeholder image">>
            <p>The earth-shaking finale to Punisher is more than just a song. It’s an experience. The song begins with Bridgers’ trademark muted vocals, speeds up and builds into a screaming wave of sound. It’s impossible to listen to without being affected by how seamlessly she navigates the end of the world. </p>
            <p>Best lyrics: “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH.”</p>
